    BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that
 works by systematically exploring all the
 nodes in a graph. At each step, it removes
 the next node in the queue and adds its
 unvisited neighbors to the queue. This
 process continues until all reachable nodes
 have been visited. The time complexity of
 BFS is O(V+E), where V is the number of
 vertices and E is the number of edges in
 the graph. However, in the worst-case
 scenario, such as when the graph is a
 complete graph, BFS takes O(V^2) time to
 explore all the nodes.
