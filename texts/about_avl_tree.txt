    An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary
 search tree where the heights of the left
 and right subtrees of any node differ by at
 most one. This ensures that the tree rem-
 ains balanced and efficient for operations
 such as insertion, deletion, and search. The
 name AVL comes from the initials of the
 inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis. AVL
 trees are commonly used in computer sci-
 ence for efficient storage and retrieval of
 data, especially in applications that require
 frequent updates and queries. Time comp-
 lexity of AVL tree operations is O(log n).
