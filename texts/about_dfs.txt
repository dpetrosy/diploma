    DFS is an algorithm for traversing or
 searching tree or graph data structures.
 The algorithm starts at the root node and
 explores as far as possible along each
 branch before backtracking. The time
 complexity of BFS is O(V+E), where V is
 the number of vertices and E is the number
 of edges in the graph. However, in the
 worst-case scenario, such as when the
 graph is a implicit graph with branching
 factor b searching to depth d, BFS takes
 O(b^d) time to explore all the nodes.
