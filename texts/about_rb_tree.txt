    The Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing
 binary search tree that ensures balance by
 using a set of rules, including that each
 node is either red or black, the root node
 is always black, and no two adjacent nodes
 can both be red. It guarantees efficient
 search and insertion times by maintaining
 the height of the tree within a small
 multiple of the logarithm of the number
 of nodes. It is widely used in applications
 that require fast and reliable search
 operations, each of which has O(log n)
 time complexity.
